<h1>Why I love twinks so fucking much</h1>
<h3>As we all know, twinks are an incredible form of man that present as youthful, elegant and effeminate. Twinks come in all colors and looks, however one common factor is that they have a slim build.<h3>
  <h2>But Dakota, what if I'm kinda muscular? I can't be a twink?</h2>
  <h3>Twinks are not muscular. However, TWUNKS are, which are "twinks/hunks". This means they have a bit of muscle on them and honestly I might actually like them a bit more, heh... But I'm making this document about twinks instead of twunks because twink is kind of an umbrella term.
    <h2>Can trans men be twinks?</h2>
    <h3>The definition of a twink includes a man. Trans men are men, and so, yes, they can be twinks.
<h1>SHOW ME THE TWINKS!!!</h1>
<h3>Sure thing! Here's my pinterest board that includes quite a lot of twinks/twunks.
